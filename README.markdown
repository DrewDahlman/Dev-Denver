This project is the code, psd, tutorial and tutorial images for a hands on working presentation on iOS development.

The working app is in the Dev-Denver directory.

You'll need the Sliced-Images if you want to build from the walkthrough in the wiki.

The psd with un-sliced images is in psd.

See https://github.com/process255/Dev-Denver/wiki/iOS-Designs-to-iPhone for the tutorial and all the info you could ever want about this project.
